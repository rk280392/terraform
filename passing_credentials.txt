Three ways of passing or allowing your ec2 instance to work with aws using terraform

1 - Create a admin role and assign it to your terraform client instance.

2 - Use provider.tf

eg --

provider "aws" {

access_key = "akcAKIIT"
secret_key = "ecvERGwjwYT"
region = "ap-south-1"

}
 

3 - export the credentials into environment 

eg --

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY = "akcAKIIT"
export AWS_SECRET_KEY = "ecvERGwjwYT"
